## 🗺️ StyleProof report

**Certification**
- **Coverage** — ✓ complete (all 2 registered surface(s) captured)
- **Determinism** — ✓ proven (base self-checked, head self-checked)
- **Inventory** — ⚠ not checked (no captured map carried an inventory — set `inventory: true` in the capture spec to arm the navigable-removal gate)
- **Confidence** — ✓ complete (2 captured)

**Product-state comparison** — ✓ comparable on 1 paired capture(s) using explicit consumer-owned identity.

⚠️ **1 baseline capture failure(s)**: these named surface(s) failed on the base SHA and were omitted from the baseline bundle: `about@auto` at `20b0af546d138ad9b9b4d352741e80fa37d1f763`. The base bundle was produced (`base-capture-failed=false`); this is not a base recapture failure. Repair the named surface(s) on that SHA; do not approve indefinitely. Raw exception details stay private.
⚠️ **1 head surface(s)** have no base map because a named baseline surface capture failed (not first adoption, not a base recapture failure): `about @ 320`.
