## 🗺️ StyleProof report

**1 change needs review**

⚠️ **1 baseline capture failure(s)**: these named surface(s) failed on the base SHA and were omitted from the baseline bundle: `about@auto` at `c160ff920b6f1acf9b023f297dff12106bb32900`. The base bundle was produced (`base-capture-failed=false`); this is not a base recapture failure. Repair the named surface(s) on that SHA; do not approve indefinitely. Raw exception details stay private.
⚠️ **1 head surface(s)** have no base map because a named baseline surface capture failed (not first adoption, not a base recapture failure): `about @ 320`.
